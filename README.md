# Fullstack-Python-Website
I created this full stack website for an assignment for the Coding Dojo. 
The completed assignment had to include:
A front-end
A back-end server
A working relational database using mySQL
Use flask to host the local server
Use bcrypt in order to hash the passwords saved in the database 
Implement CRUD 
Session to store cookies and to ensure the logged in user is actually logged in
